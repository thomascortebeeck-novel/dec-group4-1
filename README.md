Data engineering course group 4 project 1

API Chosen: Spotify

Interesting Questions:
- How a artist performs along time.
- What is the best artist in some space?
- How do the listening habits of users change during different times of the day and week, in each Country?
- Genre preference per time
- Filtering the genre
- What is the best time of the day/week/month/year to upload a new song?

Thomas:
- How many daily followers does artist x have?
- Which is the most popular song of artist x ?
- How many new followers does list x have?
# Project plan

## Objective

A short statement about the objective of your project.

Example:

> The objective of our project is to provide analytical datasets from Spotify API on artists metrics.

## Consumers

What users would find your data useful? How do they want to access the data?
Artists who want to followup on their audience and content.

Example:

> The users of our datasets are Data Analysts and the Production team in the business.

## Questions

What questions are you trying to answer with your data? How will your data support your users?

## Source datasets

What datasets are you sourcing from? How frequently are the source datasets updating?

Example:

| Source name | Source type | Source documentation |
| - | - | - |
| Customers database | PostgreSQL database | - |
| Spotify API | REST API | - |

## Solution architecture

How are we going to get data flowing from source to serving? What components and services will we combine to implement the solution? How do we automate the entire running of the solution?

- What data extraction patterns are you going to be using?
- What data loading patterns are you going to be using?
- What data transformation patterns are you going to be performing?

We recommend using a diagramming tool like [draw.io](https://draw.io/) to create your architecture diagram.

Here is a sample solution architecture diagram:
